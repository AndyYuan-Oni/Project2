## Description

### Customer Story
>As a movie lover, I want to see what other movie lovers have to say movies.
I also want to be able to share my reviews on movies I feel passionate about.
So I can make good decisions about what movies are worth watching,
and help others do the same by sharing my thoughts.

We wanted to create a movie review website where users could look up any movie and see what other people have reviewed. This could help them decide to watch a movie or not.
Secondly, users can register as a member and this allows them to also add their own reviews. 

They can also go into their profile page and delete any of their reviews that they are not happy with.

## Directions for Future Development

The search result list is needed so that the user can choose from a list of ambiguous search results. Also for the review page, a "like" button is needed for each review to add more interaction between users.

Suggested movies should alter every time the page is refreshed. And the search field can have a filter for users to choose the type of movies.

On the profile page, The CRUD is missing Update function, this feature should be added in the future. Also, the user reviews should be displaying more details including time and liked rate. A filter function should also be deployed in this page for easier organizing of all the comments.
