## Description

### Customer Story
>As a movie lover, I want to see what other movie lovers have to say movies.
I also want to be able to share my reviews on movies I feel passionate about.
So I can make good decisions about what movies are worth watching,
and help others do the same by sharing my thoughts.

We wanted to create a movie review website where users could look up any movie and see what other people have reviewed. This could help them decide to watch a movie or not.
Secondly, users can register as a member and this allows them to also add their own reviews. 

The can also go into their profile page and delete any of their reviews that they are not happy with.

## Directions for Future Development

The CRUD is missing Update, this feature should be added in the future.
