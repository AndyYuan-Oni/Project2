# Project2

We wanted to create a movie review website where users could look up any movie and see what other people have reviewed. This could help them decide to watch a movie or not.
Secondly, users can register as a member and this allows them to also add their own reviews. 
The can also go into their profile page and delete any of their reviews that they are not happy with.

# Requirements

We used Node and Express Server
We have a MySQL database
We used Sequelize 
We utilized both GET and POST  and DELETE routes for retrieving, adding and deleting data
Our App is deployed with Heroku
We utilized the themoviedb API and did ajax calls to retrieve all data about the searched movies
We then stored the user data into our database. 
We also used passport package so that users can log in and sign up
We used bcrypt js to scrabble our passwords
We did not use Bootstrap, we used Materialize Framework

# User Story

As a movie lover, I want to see what other movie lovers have to say movies, I also want to be able to share my reviews on movies I feel passionate about, so I can make good decisions about what movies are worth watching and help others do the same by sharing my thoughts.
