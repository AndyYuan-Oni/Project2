## Description

### Customer Story
>As a movie lover, I want to see what other movie lovers have to say movies.
I also want to be able to share my reviews on movies I feel passionate about.
So I can make good decisions about what movies are worth watching,
and help others do the same by sharing my reviews.


### Motivation to create this app
We wanted to create a movie review website where users could look up any movie and see what other people have reviewed. This could help them decide to watch a movie or not.
Secondly, users can register as a member and this allows them to also add their own reviews. 

They can also go into their profile page and delete any of their reviews that they are not happy with.

## Directions for Future Development

The search result list could be added so that the user can choose from a list of ambiguous search results. Also for the review page, a "like" button would be ideal for each review to add more interaction between users.

Suggested movies should ideally alter every time the page is refreshed. And the search field could have a filter for users to search movies by genre.

On the profile page, The CRUD is missing Update function, this feature could be added in the future to allow users to edit their reviews. Also, the user reviews could display more details including time/date of review and liked rate. A filter function could also be deployed in this page for easier organizing of all the comments.
